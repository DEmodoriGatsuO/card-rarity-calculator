## üåü Overview

This calculator allows users to input their high-rarity card counts and receive a detailed analysis of their collection's value. The application uses sophisticated weighting algorithms to evaluate card rarity, awards threshold bonuses for reaching specific collection milestones, and applies combo bonuses for owning multiple rarity types.

**This entire project was created using Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI**, from concept and algorithm design to the final code implementation and visual design.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use input fields with intuitive symbols
- **Progressive Weighting**: Cards of the same rarity increase in value as you collect more
- **Threshold Bonuses**: Special bonuses for reaching collection milestones
- **Combo Bonuses**: Additional points for owning multiple rarity types
- **Tier Classification**: Collections categorized into six tiers from Common to Legendary
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Complete analysis of how your score was calculated
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- **Local Storage**: Remembers your last calculation

## üíª Usage

1. Enter the number of cards you own for each rarity level:
   - ‚≠ê‚≠ê (R-6 cards)
   - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (R-7 cards)
   - üëë (R-8 cards)
2. Click "Calculate" to see your results
3. View your tier classification and detailed score breakdown

## üßÆ Calculation Method

The calculator uses the following algorithms:

- **Base Weights**:
  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê (R-6): 40 points (base) with 15% progression rate
  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (R-7): 90 points (base) with 25% progression rate
  - üëë (R-8): 475 points (base) with 35% progression rate

- **Progressive Scoring**: Each additional card of the same rarity gains increased value
  - Formula: `BaseWeight √ó [1 + (N-1) √ó ProgressionRate]` (up to a maximum multiplier)

- **Threshold Bonuses**: Additional points for reaching certain collection milestones
  - Example: Having 5 or more R-6 cards grants +100 bonus points

- **Combo Bonuses**: Points for owning multiple rarity types
  - Having all three rarities grants the maximum combo bonus

- **Tier Classification**:
  - Common: 0-200 points
  - Uncommon: 201-1,000 points
  - Rare: 1,001-2,000 points
  - Epic: 2,001-5,000 points
  - Mythic: 5,001-10,000 points
  - Legendary: 10,001+ points
